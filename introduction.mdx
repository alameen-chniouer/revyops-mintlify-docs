## What is RevyOps?

RevyOps is a campaign analytics and CRM platform built for outbound email agencies. It aggregates data from your sending platforms (Instantly, SmartLead, Lemlist, EmailBison, PlusVibe) into a single workspace, giving you unified visibility across all client campaigns.

## Core Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Campaigns">
    Campaigns represent outbound email sequences running in your connected platforms. RevyOps aggregates stats (sends, replies, bounces, interested) from each platform into a normalized view.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Contacts">
    Contacts are individual prospects in your campaigns. RevyOps maintains a unified contact record across all platforms, with support for custom fields and status tracking.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Companies">
    Companies group contacts by their organization. Custom fields and statuses can be tracked at the company level, enabling account-based reporting.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Workspaces (Clients)">
    Each workspace is an isolated client environment with its own campaigns, contacts, companies, and integrations. Agencies use workspaces to manage multiple clients.
