## Campaign Stats

The analytics dashboard aggregates performance data across all campaigns in your workspace. Key metrics include:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Total Sent" icon="paper-plane">
    All emails sent across every platform and campaign.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reply Rate" icon="reply">
    Percentage of sent emails that received a reply.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Interested Rate" icon="star">
    Percentage of sent emails where the prospect was marked interested.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Bounce Rate" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Percentage of emails that hard or soft bounced.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Date Filtering

Filter analytics by any date range using the date picker. Metrics update to reflect only activity within the selected period.

Available groupings:
- **Daily** — Day-by-day trends
- **Weekly** — Week-over-week comparison
- **Monthly** — Monthly rollup view

## A/B Variable Reporting

RevyOps supports tracking variables embedded in your campaigns (e.g. persona type, subject line variant, offer). Use the **Variable Report** to compare reply rates and interested rates across different variable values.

Example: Compare `persona=founder` vs `persona=vp-sales` across the same campaign sequence.

## Deliverability Metrics

The **Deliverability** view breaks down metrics by sending domain and inbox:

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| **Open Rate** | Emails opened ÷ emails delivered |
| **Click Rate** | Links clicked ÷ emails delivered |
| **Unsubscribe Rate** | Unsubscribes ÷ emails delivered |

<Warning>
  Deliverability metrics depend on tracking being enabled in your sending platform. Some platforms require opt-in for open tracking.
</Warning>

## Exporting Data

Export contact or company lists as CSV from any campaign or master list view. Exports include all standard fields plus custom fields.
