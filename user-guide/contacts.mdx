## Overview

Contacts represent individual email prospects. RevyOps creates or updates a contact record each time a webhook event is received from a connected platform.

## Contact Fields

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Email** | Primary identifier — must be unique per workspace |
| **First Name / Last Name** | Prospect's name |
| **Title** | Job title |
| **Phone** | Phone number |
| **Company** | Associated company record |
| **Status** | Current contact status (e.g. Active, Unsubscribed, Bounced) |
| **Custom Fields** | Flexible key-value fields defined per workspace |

## Custom Fields

Custom fields let you attach arbitrary data to contacts. Common use cases:

- Industry, company size, or revenue
- Lead score or qualification tier
- Persona or ICP tags
- Notes from the sales team

Custom fields are created per workspace and appear on all contact records.

<Note>
  Custom field values are set via the API or automatically populated from webhook payloads when the platform includes them.

## Searching Contacts

Use the **Contacts** page search to find prospects by:

- Email address
- First or last name
- Company domain
- LinkedIn URL

## Contact Status

Contacts can have the following statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `active` | Currently in an active campaign |
| `replied` | Has replied to at least one email |
| `interested` | Marked as interested |
| `unsubscribed` | Opted out |
| `bounced` | Email bounced |

## Master Contact List

The **Master List** view shows every contact in your workspace regardless of campaign, making it easy to spot duplicates or research a prospect's full history with your outreach.
