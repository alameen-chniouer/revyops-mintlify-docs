## Overview

The **Campaigns** page is the central hub of RevyOps. It shows all campaigns synced from your connected platforms with aggregated performance metrics.

## Metrics

Each campaign row shows the following metrics:

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| **Sent** | Total emails sent (including follow-ups) |
| **New Prospects** | Unique new contacts added to the campaign |
| **Replies** | Total inbound replies received |
| **Interested** | Replies manually marked as interested |
| **Bounces** | Emails that hard or soft bounced |
| **Reply Rate** | Replies ÷ Sent |
| **Interested Rate** | Interested ÷ Sent |
| **Bounce Rate** | Bounces ÷ Sent |

## Filtering

Use the filter bar at the top to narrow campaigns by:

- **Platform** — Instantly, SmartLead, Lemlist, EmailBison, PlusVibe
- **Date range** — Filter by campaign activity date
- **Status** — Active, paused, completed

## Campaign Drilldown

Click on any campaign to see a detailed breakdown:

- **Contacts** — Individual prospects with their reply and status history
- **Companies** — Account-level grouping of prospects
- **Timeline** — Email send and reply activity over time

## Marking Interested

When a reply is relevant, you can mark it as **Interested** directly from the email thread view. This increments the campaign's interested count and flags the contact for follow-up.

<Tip>
  Use the **Interested** filter on the email list to quickly find replies that need attention.

## Campaign Notes

Add notes to any campaign to track context, strategy changes, or client feedback. Notes are visible to all team members with access to the workspace.

## Archiving Campaigns

Campaigns that are no longer active can be archived to keep the dashboard clean. Archived campaigns are hidden by default but remain searchable.
