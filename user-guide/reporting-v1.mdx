### Campaign Notes

Admins can attach notes to any campaign — useful for tracking strategy changes, client feedback, or context about a campaign's performance. Notes are visible to all workspace members.

### Archiving Campaigns

Admins can archive campaigns to hide them from the default view. Archived campaigns remain accessible via a toggle but are excluded from aggregate metrics.

### Campaign Comparison
