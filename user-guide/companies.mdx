## Overview

Companies represent the organizations your contacts belong to. RevyOps automatically associates contacts with companies based on their email domain or explicit company data from webhook payloads.

## Company Fields

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Domain** | Primary identifier — the company's website domain |
| **Name** | Company name |
| **Status** | Current account status |
| **Custom Fields** | Flexible key-value fields defined per workspace |

## Custom Fields

Just like contacts, companies support custom fields for tracking account-level data:

- Revenue range or ARR
- Industry or vertical
- Account owner or SDR assigned
- ICP score
- HubSpot deal stage

## Company Status

Track the current state of each account:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `active` | Contacts at this company are actively being outreached |
| `replied` | At least one contact has replied |
| `interested` | At least one contact is marked interested |
| `not-interested` | Explicitly marked as not a fit |
| `customer` | Existing customer — suppress from outreach |

## Account-Based View

The **Companies** drilldown shows:

- All contacts at the company
- Which campaigns they've appeared in
- Aggregate reply and interested counts across all contacts

This gives you an account-level view of engagement — useful for knowing whether a company has already been worked before starting a new campaign.

## Master Company List

The **Master List** view lets you browse, search, and filter all companies in your workspace. Export to CSV for reporting or import into your CRM.
