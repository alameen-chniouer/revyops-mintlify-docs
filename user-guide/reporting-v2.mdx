description: Advanced campaign analytics with time series charts, smart views, drilldowns, and A/B variable reporting.
---

## Overview

Reporting v2 is a complete redesign of the reporting experience. It adds time series charts, a smart filter system with saved views, contact-level drilldowns, and a persistent layout that remembers your preferences.

---

## Key Improvements Over v1

| Feature | v1 | v2 |
|---|---|---|
| Time series charts | — | Daily / weekly / monthly |
| Saved filter views | — | Smart Views |
| Contact drilldown | Basic | Full panel with email thread |
| Filter persistence | — | State preserved across sessions |
| Metrics visibility | Fixed | Configurable — show/hide/reorder |
| Funnel steps | — | Customisable funnel config |
| Benchmarks panel | — | Side-by-side benchmark comparison |

---

## Metrics

All v1 metrics are available in v2, plus:

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| **Time Series** | Sends, replies, interested plotted over time (daily / weekly / monthly) |
| **Funnel View** | Configurable step-by-step funnel from sent → interested |
| **Aggregate Cards** | Top-level KPIs across all selected campaigns |

---

## Filters

The filter system in v2 supports multi-dimensional filtering:

- **Platform (Sequencer)** — filter by Instantly, SmartLead, Lemlist, EmailBison, PlusVibe
- **Campaigns** — search and select individual campaigns
- **Date Range** — window for all activity metrics
- **Date Grouping** — aggregate time series by day, week, or month

Active filters are shown as chips at the top of the page. Remove any filter individually or clear all at once.

## Smart Views

Smart Views let you save any filter combination as a named view and reload it instantly.

**To save a view:**
1. Set your filters the way you want
2. Click **Save View**
3. Give it a name (e.g. "Q1 Instantly Campaigns")

Saved views appear in the sidebar. Clicking one instantly restores all filters, date ranges, and metric visibility preferences.

<Tip>
  Create a Smart View for each client or campaign type you review regularly — this eliminates repetitive filter setup.

## Campaign Breakdown Table

The campaign breakdown table shows all campaigns matching your filters with full metric columns. You can:

- Sort by any metric
- Search by campaign name
- Select campaigns for comparison
- Archive or add notes (admins only)

### Disposition Breakdown

Expand any campaign to see how replies are categorised: Not Now, Wrong Person, Out of Office, Interested, etc. This data is synced from your sending platform's reply classification.

---

## Contact Drilldown

Click into any campaign metric (sends, replies, bounces, interested) to open the **Data Panel** — a slide-out showing every individual contact in that metric bucket.

From the Data Panel you can:

- Search contacts by name, email, or company
- Switch between **Contacts** and **Companies** grouping
- Click any contact to view the full email thread

### Email Thread View

The email thread shows every outbound email and inbound reply for that contact, across all campaigns. Timestamps, subject lines, and full email bodies are included.

---

## Variable Report (A/B Testing)

The Variable Report lets you analyse performance across **tracking variables** — custom tags you embed in campaigns to identify variants (e.g. persona, offer, subject line).

### How It Works

1. Select 1–3 tracking variables to compare (e.g. `tracking_persona`, `tracking_offer`)
2. Choose which values to include per variable, or select "All Variants"
3. RevyOps groups all matching emails by variable combination and calculates metrics for each group

### Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| **Combinations Found** | Number of unique variable value combinations |
| **Total Sent** | Emails sent for each combination |
| **Unique Prospects** | Distinct contacts reached |
| **Reply Rate** | Replies ÷ Sent |
| **Interested Rate** | Interested ÷ Sent |
| **Bounce Rate** | Bounces ÷ Sent |
| **Rank** | Combinations ranked by interested rate (1st = best) |

### Filters

The variable report supports additional minimum thresholds to exclude low-volume combinations from skewing results:

| Filter | Description |
|---|---|
| **Min Sends** | Only include combinations with at least N sends |
| **Min Replies** | Only include combinations with at least N replies |
| **Min Interested** | Only include combinations with at least N interested replies |
| **Min Bounces** | Only include combinations with at least N bounces |
| **Max Ratio** | Exclude combinations with a ratio worse than 1:X |

<Note>
  Tracking variables must be set on your campaigns in the sending platform before they will appear in the variable report. Variable fields follow the naming convention `tracking_*`.
</Note>

## Benchmarks Panel

Open the Benchmarks panel alongside your campaign data to compare your performance against reference benchmarks. This is useful for identifying campaigns that are significantly above or below your typical baseline.
