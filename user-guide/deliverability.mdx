title: Deliverability
description: Monitor sending domain and inbox health across all your campaigns.
---

## Overview

The Deliverability view breaks down email performance by **sending domain** and **individual inbox**, giving you visibility into which domains and inboxes are performing well and which may be experiencing delivery issues.

---

## How It Works

RevyOps analyses every outbound email across your campaigns and groups the results by:

1. **Domain** — the domain part of the sending email address (e.g. `yourdomain.com`)
2. **Inbox** — the full sending email address (e.g. `john@yourdomain.com`)

This lets you quickly spot if a specific domain or inbox is responsible for a spike in bounces or a drop in reply rates.

## Metrics

### Domain Level

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| **Domain** | The sending domain |
| **Inboxes** | Number of unique inboxes sending from this domain |
| **Total Sends** | All outbound emails sent from this domain |
| **Total Replies** | Inbound replies received to emails from this domain |

### Inbox Level (expanded)

Expand any domain to see per-inbox statistics:

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| **Inbox** | The full sending email address |
| **Total Sends** | Outbound emails sent from this inbox |
| **Total Replies** | Replies received to this inbox |

## Filtering

Use the date range filter to scope deliverability data to a specific period:

- **Start Date** — only include sends from this date onwards
- **End Date** — only include sends up to this date

This is useful when investigating whether a deliverability issue is recent or has been ongoing.

## Reading the Data

**High sends, low replies on a specific domain** — may indicate deliverability problems (emails landing in spam, domain reputation issues, or inbox warmup needed).

**One inbox with significantly lower reply rates** — that specific inbox may have reputation issues separate from the rest of the domain.

**Uneven send distribution** — if most sends come from a single inbox, consider spreading volume across more inboxes for better inbox rotation.

<Tip>
  Cross-reference deliverability data with your sending platform's bounce reports. A high bounce rate in RevyOps combined with platform-side alerts is a strong signal to pause that inbox and investigate.
