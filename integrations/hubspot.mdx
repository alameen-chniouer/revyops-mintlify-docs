description: Sync contacts and companies between RevyOps and HubSpot CRM.

## Overview

The HubSpot integration syncs contacts and companies from RevyOps into HubSpot CRM. This keeps your CRM up to date with outbound activity without manual data entry.

## Prerequisites

- A HubSpot account with CRM access
- Your RevyOps `client_id`
- HubSpot API credentials configured in RevyOps settings

## Sync Flow

```
RevyOps Contact → HubSpot Contact
RevyOps Company → HubSpot Company
```

When a contact replies or is marked interested in RevyOps, HubSpot contact properties are updated automatically.

## Initial Sync

The initial sync imports all existing RevyOps contacts into HubSpot in batches. Contact your RevyOps admin to trigger this if it hasn't run yet.

## Webhook Events

RevyOps listens for HubSpot webhook events to keep contact data in sync bidirectionally:

| Event | Description |
|---|---|
| `contact.creation` | New HubSpot contact created |
| `contact.propertyChange` | HubSpot contact property updated |
| `contact.deletion` | HubSpot contact deleted |
| `contact.merge` | Two HubSpot contacts merged |

The webhook endpoint for HubSpot events:

```
https://api.revyops.com/public/hubspot-webhook/{client_id}
```

## Custom Properties

RevyOps can create custom properties in HubSpot to store RevyOps-specific data such as campaign name and reply status. These are configured from the RevyOps admin settings during the initial HubSpot setup.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Contacts not appearing in HubSpot">
    Verify HubSpot API credentials are correctly configured in RevyOps settings. Check that the contact email is valid and not duplicated in HubSpot.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Webhook events not received">
    Confirm the webhook URL is registered in your HubSpot account under **Settings → Integrations → Private Apps → Webhooks**.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Properties not updating">
    Ensure the custom HubSpot properties were created during the initial setup. HubSpot will reject property values for fields that don't exist in your HubSpot account.
  </Accordion>
