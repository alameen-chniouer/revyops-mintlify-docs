## How Integrations Work

RevyOps receives data from your sending platforms through **webhooks**. When an email is sent, replied to, or bounced, the platform sends an event to your RevyOps webhook URL. RevyOps processes that event and updates the campaign, contact, and email records in real time.

```
Sending Platform → Webhook Event → RevyOps → Campaign / Contact / Email records
```

## Webhook URL Format

Each platform has a dedicated webhook endpoint:

| Platform | Webhook URL |
|---|---|
| Instantly | `https://api.revyops.com/public/instantly-webhook/{client_id}` |
| SmartLead | `https://api.revyops.com/public/smartlead-webhook/{client_id}` |
| Lemlist | `https://api.revyops.com/public/lemlist-webhook/{client_id}` |
| EmailBison | `https://api.revyops.com/public/emailbison-webhook/{client_id}` |
| PlusVibe | `https://api.revyops.com/public/plusvibe-webhook/{client_id}` |
| HubSpot | `https://api.revyops.com/public/hubspot-webhook/{client_id}` |

Replace `{client_id}` with your workspace ID from **Settings → Workspace**.

## Agency-Level Webhooks

For agencies managing multiple client workspaces, global webhooks route events to the correct workspace automatically:

| Platform | Global Webhook URL |
|---|---|
| Instantly | `https://api.revyops.com/public/global-instantly-webhook/{agency_id}` |
| SmartLead | `https://api.revyops.com/public/global-smartlead-webhook/{agency_id}` |
| Lemlist | `https://api.revyops.com/public/global-lemlist-webhook/{agency_id}` |
| EmailBison | `https://api.revyops.com/public/global-emailbison-webhook/{agency_id}` |
