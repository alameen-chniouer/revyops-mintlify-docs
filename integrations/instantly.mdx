## Prerequisites

- An active Instantly account
- Your RevyOps `client_id` (find it under **Settings → Workspace**)

## Webhook Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Instantly Settings">
    In Instantly, go to **Settings → Integrations → Webhooks**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a New Webhook">
    Click **Add Webhook** and enter the following URL:

    ```
    https://api.revyops.com/public/instantly-webhook/{client_id}
    ```

    Replace `{client_id}` with your RevyOps workspace ID.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Events">
    Enable the following event types:
    - `Email Sent`
    - `Email Reply`
    - `Email Bounced`
    - `Unsubscribed`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and Test">
    Save the webhook and use the **Send Test** button to verify RevyOps receives the event.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Agency Setup (Global Webhook)

For agencies managing multiple client workspaces, use the global webhook instead:

```
https://api.revyops.com/public/global-instantly-webhook/{agency_id}
```

This single webhook automatically routes events to the correct client workspace based on the campaign's workspace mapping in RevyOps.
