## Webhook Architecture

RevyOps webhook endpoints receive `POST` requests from your sending platforms. Each event is processed synchronously and immediately reflected in the campaign, contact, and email records.

All webhook endpoints respond with:
- `200 OK` — event processed successfully
- `400 Bad Request` — malformed payload
- `404 Not Found` — unknown `client_id`

## Endpoint Reference

### Per-Client Webhooks

These endpoints are scoped to a single workspace. Use them when each client has their own sending platform account.

| Platform | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| Instantly | `POST /public/instantly-webhook/{client_id}` |
| SmartLead | `POST /public/smartlead-webhook/{client_id}` |
| Lemlist | `POST /public/lemlist-webhook/{client_id}` |
| EmailBison | `POST /public/emailbison-webhook/{client_id}` |
| PlusVibe | `POST /public/plusvibe-webhook/{client_id}` |
| HubSpot | `POST /public/hubspot-webhook/{client_id}` |

### Agency-Level (Global) Webhooks

Use these when a single sending platform account is shared across multiple client workspaces. RevyOps routes events to the correct workspace automatically.

| Platform | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| Instantly | `POST /public/global-instantly-webhook/{agency_id}` |
| SmartLead | `POST /public/global-smartlead-webhook/{agency_id}` |
| Lemlist | `POST /public/global-lemlist-webhook/{agency_id}` |
| EmailBison | `POST /public/global-emailbison-webhook/{agency_id}` |

## Event Types Processed

| Event | What RevyOps Does |
|---|---|
| Email Sent | Creates or updates the email record, updates campaign send count |
| Email Reply (Inbound) | Creates inbound email record, updates reply count |
| Email Bounced | Marks email as bounced, updates bounce count |
| Unsubscribed | Updates contact status to `unsubscribed` |

## Idempotency

Webhooks are idempotent — sending the same event multiple times will not create duplicate records. RevyOps deduplicates based on the email address + campaign + timestamp combination.

## Debugging Webhook Events

If events are not appearing in RevyOps:

1. Confirm the webhook URL includes your correct `client_id`
2. Check your sending platform's webhook delivery logs for any error responses
3. Verify the platform is sending the correct event types
4. Use the **Emails** section in RevyOps to see if any records arrived with unexpected data

<Tip>
  Most sending platforms show webhook delivery history with request/response details. Check these logs first when debugging connectivity issues.
