title: Quickstart
description: Connect your first sending platform and start seeing data in RevyOps.
---

## Overview

Setting up RevyOps takes about 5 minutes. You will:

1. Obtain your API key
2. Configure a webhook in your sending platform
3. Verify data is flowing into your workspace

---

## Step 1 — Get Your API Key

Every API request requires a `client_id` that identifies your workspace. You can find it in the RevyOps dashboard under **Settings → Workspace**.

<Note>
  Keep your `client_id` secure. It is used to authenticate webhook events and API calls.
</Note>

## Step 2 — Connect a Sending Platform

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Step 3 — Verify the Connection

After configuring the webhook, send a test event from your platform. In the RevyOps dashboard:

1. Go to **Campaigns**
2. Look for the campaign you triggered the event from
3. Confirm that sends, replies, or bounces are showing up

<Tip>
  Most platforms send a test payload when you save the webhook. Check the **Emails** section to confirm the record was received.
</Tip>

## Step 4 — (Optional) Connect HubSpot

If you use HubSpot as your CRM, follow the [HubSpot integration guide](/integrations/hubspot) to sync contacts and companies bidirectionally.
