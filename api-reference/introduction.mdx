title: API Introduction
description: The RevyOps REST API lets you read and write contacts, companies, emails, and custom fields.
---

## Base URL

```
https://api.revyops.com
```

## Authentication

All public API endpoints require a `client_id` query parameter that identifies your workspace.

```http
GET /public/contacts?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
```

Find your `client_id` in the RevyOps dashboard under **Settings → Workspace**.

<Warning>
  Treat your `client_id` like a secret. Anyone with this value can read and write data in your workspace.
</Warning>

## Versioning

The API has two versions:

| Version | Base Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| v1 | `/public/` | Original endpoints — still supported |
| v2 | `/public/v2/` | Recommended — improved filtering and pagination |

All new integrations should use **v2** endpoints.

## Response Format

All responses are JSON. Successful responses return the requested data directly or wrapped in a results array.

```json
{
  "count": 100,
  "next": "https://api.revyops.com/public/v2/contacts?page=2",
  "previous": null,
  "results": [...]
}
```

## Error Format

```json
{
  "detail": "Not found."
}
```

Common HTTP status codes:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `200` | Success |
| `201` | Created |
| `204` | Deleted (no content) |
| `400` | Bad request — check your payload |
| `404` | Resource not found |
| `500` | Server error |

## Pagination

List endpoints support pagination via `page` and `page_size` query parameters:

```
GET /public/v2/contacts?page=2&page_size=50
```

Default page size is 100. Maximum is 1000.

## Rate Limits

The API does not currently enforce rate limits, but avoid sending more than 10 requests per second from a single client to prevent server-side throttling.
