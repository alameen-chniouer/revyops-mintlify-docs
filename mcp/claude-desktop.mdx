description: Connect the RevyOps MCP server to Claude Desktop.
---

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) installed
- A RevyOps API key — get one from **Settings → API Keys**

---

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Claude Desktop config">
    Find the config file for your operating system:

    **macOS:**
    ```
    ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
    ```

    **Windows:**
    ```
    %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
    ```

    Create the file if it doesn't exist.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the RevyOps server">
    Add the following JSON (merge with any existing MCP servers you have):

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "revyops": {
          "type": "http",
          "url": "https://mcp.revyops.com/mcp",
          "headers": {
            "X-API-KEY": "RO-your-api-key-here"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Replace `RO-your-api-key-here` with your actual API key.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Restart Claude Desktop">
    Quit and reopen Claude Desktop. The RevyOps tools will appear automatically in the tools panel.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the connection">
    In a new conversation, ask:

    > *"List my RevyOps clients"*

    Claude should respond with your available workspace(s).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Multiple Workspaces

If you manage multiple client workspaces, add a separate server entry per API key:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "revyops-client-a": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.revyops.com/mcp",
      "headers": { "X-API-KEY": "RO-key-for-client-a" }
    },
    "revyops-client-b": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.revyops.com/mcp",
      "headers": { "X-API-KEY": "RO-key-for-client-b" }
    }
  }
}
```

Or pass a comma-separated list of keys in a single entry:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "revyops": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.revyops.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "X-API-KEY": "RO-key-for-client-a,RO-key-for-client-b"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Use `list_clients` to see all resolved workspaces, then reference them by name in your prompts.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tools not appearing in Claude">
    Make sure you fully quit Claude Desktop (not just closed the window) and reopened it. On macOS, right-click the Dock icon and select **Quit**.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Authentication failed error">
    Double-check your API key in **RevyOps → Settings → API Keys**. Keys must start with `RO-`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cannot connect to server">
    Verify your internet connection and that `https://mcp.revyops.com` is reachable. If you're self-hosting, check that your MCP server is running and the URL is correct.
