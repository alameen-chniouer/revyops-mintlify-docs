## What is the RevyOps MCP Server?

The RevyOps MCP (Model Context Protocol) server lets you talk to your campaign data directly inside [Claude](https://claude.ai). Once connected, you can ask Claude natural language questions about your campaigns, contacts, and deliverability — and it will query RevyOps in real time to answer.

```
You → Claude → RevyOps MCP Server → RevyOps API → Your data
```

## Example Prompts

Once connected, you can ask Claude things like:

- *"Show me campaign performance for last month"*
- *"Which campaigns have the highest reply rate this week?"*
- *"Find all contacts at acme.com"*
- *"What's our deliverability looking like across sending domains?"*
- *"Mark the reply from john@example.com as interested"*
- *"Archive the SmartLead campaign called Q1 Outreach"*
